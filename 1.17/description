For this exercise, I decided to make a solution in order to do simple Python script testing.
Starting a dedicated program such as MATLAB can take too long for quick tests, so a docker image could be a good alternative.
When the image is run, a Python environment including numpy and pandas libraries is started.

For future implementations, other libraries are easy to include to Dockerfile.
